# 288
My First Repository

This project is created partially for myself to understand the global things you can do using GitHub.
This project has important information, so to read the contents as described on screen you will end up with none or more knowledge.
To get started one should read the described contents on pages regarding 288's repository.
If you need more information about this subject matter, you can send me an e-mail-message after. 
FAQ:
1. Why is 288's repository designed?
  • To learn things related to GitHub and GitHub itself.
2. I don't understand why this is important for me as a user.
  • True, it might not be that important because the languages are mixed up and it is more for the owner to learn and experience new things.
3. I have a question how can I ask?
  • As I've said earlier you can send me an e-mail message, but it might not worth it to ask a question since this should be a private repository instead.
    Since it is a monthly payment I use the free.
